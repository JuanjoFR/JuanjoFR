## About Me

I'm a curious builder who enjoys understanding how systems work and solving real-world problems with technology.

With over **10 years of experience** in software development, I specialize in **full-stack web development**, designing and building both frontend interfaces and backend systems that power scalable digital products.

Today, I focus on developing **modern web applications** using React and Next.js, architecting robust backend services with Node.js and relational or NoSQL databases, and integrating **AI capabilities directly into production systems** — from intelligent workflows to AI-assisted user experiences.

I combine product thinking with solid engineering principles to ship maintainable, scalable and meaningful software.

## Current Focus

- Building end-to-end web applications with **React & Next.js**
- Designing scalable backend architectures with **Node.js**
- Working with **PostgreSQL - Supabase**
- Applying **Hexagonal Architecture** in real-world production systems
- Integrating **AI-driven features and AI agents into web platforms**
- Launching and iterating on independent software products
